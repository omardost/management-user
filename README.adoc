== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.5&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=testing-restdocs&name=testing-restdocs&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.testing-restdocs&dependencies=web[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Run the Application

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application
  context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath
  settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@EnableWebMvc`: Flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors,
  such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`. Spring Boot adds it  automatically when it sees
  `spring-webmvc` on the classpath.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an
application. Did you notice that there is not a single line of XML? There is no `web.xml`
file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with
configuring any plumbing or infrastructure. Spring Boot handles all of that for you.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.
